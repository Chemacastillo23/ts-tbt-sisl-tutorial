# of Carbon and perform a transiesta calculation.

# The chain should consist of Carbon atoms with
# an inter-atomic distance of 1.5 Ã….

# 1. Create the electrode
#    Supply the coordinates,
#    Note that you _have_ to decide the semi-infinite
#    direction by ensuring the electrode to 
#    be periodic in the semi-infinite direction.

# 2. Create the device
#    The basic unit-cell for a fully periodic device
#    system is 3-times the electrode size.
#    HINT: If you are not fully sure why this is, please
