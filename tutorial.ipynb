    "  A basic example of how to create electronic structures in `sisl`.  \n",
    "  The graphene electronic structure is recreated from a simple tight-binding calculation.\n",
    "  In this example you will get your first glance at `sisl` code and how to utilize it for simple things.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- [Example 2](02/run.ipynb)  \n",
    "  Creation of your first tight-binding Hamiltonian for TBtrans.\n",
    "  This, again, creates a graphene device with 2 electrodes and a small scattering region.\n",
    "  After having created the electronic structure to be fed into TBtrans you will run TBtrans. Then returning to the tutorial script you will run some data-analysis using `sisl` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Example 3](03/run.ipynb)  \n",
    "  Create transport in a skewed lattice. This exemplifies the generality of TBtrans, but also TranSiesta for cases where skewed transport directions reduces the computational effort.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- [Example 4](04/run.ipynb)  \n",
    "  Introduction to the `sisl.io` module which interfaces the build-in file types. In this case we concentrate on the TBtrans output file `*.TBT.nc` where `sisl` is the primary tool to perform data-analysis. Extraction of transmission, DOS, spectral DOS and the aforementioned quantities on individiual subsets of atoms.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- [Example 5](05/run.ipynb)  \n",
    "  Same system as in [04](04/run.ipynb). This example shows you the importance of utilising the periodicity in the electrodes. The exercises elaborates on [04](04/run.ipynb) and will teach you to extract transmission and density of states quantities on a *per $\\mathbf k$-point* case, thus enabling investigations on a Brillouin zone level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Example 6](06/run.ipynb)  \n",
    "  The first $N>2$-electrode example with a cross-bar graphene nano-ribbon system. You will learn to extract data from a calculation with multiple electrodes and also explore details of symmetry for $N>2$ electrode systems.\n",
